Date: 2026-01-16
Status: COMPLETE - All tasks finished, story moved to 'review'

Tasks Completed:
1. Initialize monorepo root structure
   - Created .gitignore with comprehensive exclusions
   - Updated package.json with monorepo configuration and scripts
   - Verified turbo 2.7.4 installation

2. Configure pnpm workspace
   - Created pnpm-workspace.yaml with apps/* and packages/* patterns
   - Verified workspace configuration

3. Configure Turborepo pipelines
   - Created turbo.json with tasks: build, test, lint, dev, clean
   - IMPORTANT: Used 'tasks' field (Turbo 2.x) instead of deprecated 'pipeline'
   - Configured caching and task dependencies

4. Create workspace directory structure
   - Created apps/web/, apps/api/
   - Created packages/contracts/, packages/types/, packages/ui/, packages/config/
   - Added .gitkeep files to all directories

5. Add root-level scripts
   - All scripts added: dev, build, test, lint, clean
   - All use 'turbo run' for task orchestration

6. Verify monorepo setup
   - pnpm install: SUCCESS
   - Turbo cache created at .turbo/cache/
   - Dry-run tests: PASS

Files Created:
- .gitignore
- pnpm-workspace.yaml
- turbo.json
