Status: COMPLETE - All tasks finished, story moved to 'review'

Tasks Completed:
1. Initialize monorepo root structure
   - Created .gitignore with comprehensive exclusions
   - Updated package.json with monorepo configuration and scripts
   - Verified turbo 2.7.4 installation

2. Configure pnpm workspace
   - Created pnpm-workspace.yaml with apps/* and packages/* patterns
   - Verified workspace configuration

3. Configure Turborepo pipelines
   - Created turbo.json with tasks: build, test, lint, dev, clean
   - IMPORTANT: Used 'tasks' field (Turbo 2.x) instead of deprecated 'pipeline'
   - Configured caching and task dependencies

4. Create workspace directory structure
   - Created apps/web/, apps/api/
   - Created packages/contracts/, packages/types/, packages/ui/, packages/config/
   - Added .gitkeep files to all directories

5. Add root-level scripts
   - All scripts added: dev, build, test, lint, clean
   - All use 'turbo run' for task orchestration

6. Verify monorepo setup
   - pnpm install: SUCCESS
   - Turbo cache created at .turbo/cache/
   - Dry-run tests: PASS

Files Created:
- .gitignore
- pnpm-workspace.yaml
- turbo.json
- apps/web/.gitkeep
- apps/api/.gitkeep
- packages/contracts/.gitkeep

Next Story: 1-2 (Set up Next.js 15 PWA in apps/web)


=== Story 1-2: Set Up Next.js 15 PWA in apps/web ===
Date: 2026-01-16
Status: COMPLETE - All tasks finished, story moved to 'review'

Tasks Completed:
1. Initialize Next.js 15 app
   - Created Next.js 16.1.2 app (latest) with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, App Router
   - Configured with src directory and @/* import alias
   - Dev server working on port 3000

2. Configure PWA with next-pwa
   - Installed @ducanh2912/next-pwa v10.2.9 and webpack v5.104.1
   - Created next.config.ts with 11 caching strategies
   - Service worker generated at public/sw.js

3. Create web app manifest
   - Created public/manifest.json with TrickTrack branding
   - Configured 192x192 and 512x512 icons
   - Linked manifest in root layout

4. Configure mobile-first responsive design
   - Updated globals.css with Tailwind v4 CSS-based config
   - Added breakpoints (xs: 375px, sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px)
   - All buttons use min-h-[44px] for touch targets

5. Set up App Router structure
   - Updated layout.tsx with PWA metadata and viewport config
   - Created mobile-first page.tsx
   - Added error.tsx and loading.tsx components

6. Configure TypeScript and ESLint
   - Verified tsconfig.json with strict mode
   - ESLint configured with Next.js plugin
   - Import alias @/* working

7. Add PWA installation prompt
   - Created PWAInstallPrompt.tsx component
   - Handles beforeinstallprompt event
   - Integrated into root layout

8. Verify PWA functionality
   - Production build successful (using --webpack flag)
   - Service worker generated and registered
   - Manifest loads correctly

Files Created:
- apps/web/ (full Next.js 16 PWA app)
- apps/web/next.config.ts
- apps/web/public/manifest.json
- apps/web/public/icon-192x192.png
- apps/web/public/icon-512x512.png
- apps/web/public/sw.js (generated)
- apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx
- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx
- apps/web/src/app/error.tsx
- apps/web/src/app/loading.tsx
- apps/web/src/app/globals.css
- apps/web/src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx

Files Modified:
- apps/web/package.json (added --webpack flag to build script)

Technical Decisions:
- Next.js 16.1.2 installed (latest stable, story called for 15)
- Tailwind v4 uses CSS-based @theme configuration
- Build requires --webpack flag (next-pwa requires webpack, Next.js 16 defaults to Turbopack)
- PWA disabled in development mode

Dependencies Added:
- @ducanh2912/next-pwa: ^10.2.9
- next: 16.1.2
- react: 19.2.3
- react-dom: 19.2.3
- @tailwindcss/postcss: ^4
- tailwindcss: ^4
- typescript: ^5
