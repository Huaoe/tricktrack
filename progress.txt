- Used individual plugins instead of @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox due to peer dependency conflicts
- Used .cjs config file extension to avoid ESM/CJS conflicts
- Solidity version: 0.8.20 with optimizer enabled (200 runs)

Blockers:
- Test runner not discovering TypeScript test files (known Hardhat 2 + TS + Mocha configuration issue)
- Needs investigation into mocha TypeScript configuration

Verification Status:
- ✅ Compilation works: `pnpm compile`
- ✅ OpenZeppelin imports work
- ✅ TypeChain types generated
- ✅ Gas reporter configured
- ✅ Polygon networks configured  
- ⚠️  Test runner needs configuration fix

Next Story: Continue Story 1-4 (fix test runner) or move to Story 1-5


=== Story 1-4 FINAL UPDATE ===
Date: 2026-01-16
Status: COMPLETE - All tasks finished, tests passing

FINAL VERIFICATION:
✅ Compilation: Contracts compile successfully
✅ Testing: All 9 tests passing
✅ OpenZeppelin: Imports work correctly
✅ TypeChain: Types generated successfully
✅ Polygon Networks: Configured (Mumbai + Mainnet)
✅ Gas Reporter: Configured
✅ Directory Structure: Complete

FILES CREATED:

- packages/contracts/.env.example
- packages/contracts/contracts/Lock.sol
- packages/contracts/test/Lock.test.js
- packages/contracts/tsconfig.json
- packages/contracts/.mocharc.json
- packages/contracts/package.json (fully configured)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET:
✅ AC1: Hardhat test suite runs successfully with `pnpm test`
✅ AC1: Setup includes Hardhat 2, TypeScript support, OpenZeppelin contracts, testing framework, deployment scripts, network configurations for Polygon

TECHNICAL NOTE:
- Used Hardhat 2.22.17 (not 3.x) due to Node.js 20 compatibility and plugin stability
- Tests written in JavaScript (.js) as Hardhat 2 defaults to discovering .js files
- TypeScript support via ts-node works for contracts and scripts
- All core functionality verified and working
