# Product Brief: TrickTrack

<!-- Content will be appended sequentially through collaborative workflow steps -->

## Executive Summary

TrickTrack is a decentralized skateboarding platform that transforms trick validation into a community-driven, rewarding experience. Unlike existing tracking apps (Ollee) or social media platforms (Instagram/YouTube) that focus on metrics or vanity engagement, TrickTrack introduces **peer-certified skill validation** backed by crypto rewards and NFT achievements, governed by an Aragon DAO with a charitable mission to support global skateboarding communities.

**The Opportunity:** Skateboarders lack authentic skill certification and meaningful rewards for progression. Current solutions offer stats tracking or social likes, but no trusted validation system that proves mastery while rewarding achievement.

**The Solution:** A PWA that enables skaters to request validation from trusted peers (QR-connected friends), earn crypto tokens for certified tricks (90% consensus threshold), collect NFT badges, and participate in DAO governance that funds skateboarding charities worldwide.

**Market Differentiation:** First platform combining peer validation, blockchain rewards, and charitable impact—creating a virtuous cycle where skaters earn, prove skills, and give back to the community.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

**Skateboarders face three critical challenges:**

1. **No Authentic Skill Certification**  
   Current apps (Ollee, manual spreadsheets) track sessions but can't verify if tricks were actually landed cleanly. Social media views/likes don't equate to skill validation—anyone can post edited footage.

2. **Meaningless Engagement Without Rewards**  
   Skaters spend hours perfecting tricks for Instagram likes or YouTube views, but receive no tangible value. The pressure to perform for social algorithms creates burnout without financial or community recognition.

3. **Disconnected Progression Tracking**  
   Skaters progress in isolation using spreadsheets or memory. There's no trusted network to validate achievements, celebrate milestones, or create verifiable skill records that sponsors or communities recognize.

### Problem Impact

**For Individual Skaters:**
- Wasted effort posting tricks with no validation or rewards
- Imposter syndrome—no way to prove skill level objectively
- Missed sponsorship opportunities due to lack of verified credentials

**For the Skateboarding Community:**
- Fragmented skill recognition across platforms
- No collective way to support skateparks, youth programs, or underserved communities
- Talent discovery relies on viral luck rather than verified skill

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Solution | What It Does | What It Misses |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Ollee** | Tracks session stats (ride time, tricks landed) with leaderboards | No peer validation—self-reported tricks, no skill certification, no rewards |
| **Instagram/YouTube** | Social sharing with likes/views | Vanity metrics don't prove skill, no monetization for skaters, algorithm-driven pressure |
| **Manual Tracking** | Spreadsheets for personal progression | Isolated, no community validation, no incentives |

**The Gap:** No platform combines **trusted peer validation** + **crypto rewards** + **community governance** + **charitable impact**.

### Proposed Solution

**TrickTrack** is a decentralized PWA where skaters:

1. **Request Peer Validation**  
   Select QR-connected friends to validate trick attempts via simple scoring form (90% threshold required)

2. **Earn Crypto Rewards**  
   Fixed ERC-20 token rewards per trick difficulty (Ollie: 10 tokens, Kickflip: 25, Hardflip: 50) on Polygon blockchain

3. **Collect NFT Badges**  
   Tiered ERC-721 NFTs (Bronze/Silver/Gold) for achievements, with sponsor-exclusive editions

4. **Participate in DAO Governance**  
   Aragon DAO on Polygon enables token holders to vote on platform features, charity recipients, and revenue allocation

5. **Support Global Skateboarding**  
   Platform allocates revenue percentage to skateparks, youth programs, and equipment donations—voted on by the community

### Key Differentiators

**1. Trusted Peer Validation Network**  
Unlike self-reported stats (Ollee) or unverified social posts, TrickTrack uses QR-connected friend networks for authentic skill certification. Validators can film attempts and score based on clean landing (50%), style (30%), and difficulty (20%).

**2. Blockchain-Powered Rewards**  
First skateboarding app with crypto tokenomics—skaters earn tangible value for progression, not just likes. Polygon ensures low gas fees for mainstream adoption.

**3. DAO Charitable Mission**  
Aragon DAO governance aligns incentives: skaters earn tokens, sponsors fund pools, and the community votes to support skateboarding organizations worldwide. Users are "blessed to participate" through transparent on-chain donations.

**4. Sponsor-Driven Economy**  
Three-tier sponsorship model (Local Shops $500-2k, Brands $5-15k, Premium $20k+) funds token pools and custom NFT badges, creating sustainable revenue while rewarding skaters.

**5. Wallet Flexibility**  
In-app wallet creation (simplified onboarding) or external wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect) removes crypto barriers for mainstream skaters.

**Why Now:**  
- Web3 adoption growing in sports/gaming  
- Skateboarding's Olympic inclusion increased mainstream interest  
- DAO tooling (Aragon) matured for non-technical communities  
- Polygon's low fees enable microtransactions for trick rewards

### MVP Success Criteria

**Go/No-Go Decision Points:**

**After 3 Months (MVP Launch):**
- ✅ **User Adoption:** 500+ wallet connections (50% of 1,000 target)
- ✅ **Validation Completion:** 70%+ of validation requests receive responses
- ✅ **Token Distribution:** 25,000+ tokens distributed (50% of target)

**Proceed to Phase 2 if:**
- Users consistently request validation (2+ per week average)
- Validator response rate stays above 70%
- Token rewards drive repeat engagement
- DAO voting participation reaches 10%+ of token holders
- Sponsor inquiries indicate market demand

**Pivot/Adjust if:**
- Validation requests drop below 1 per user/month (engagement issue)
